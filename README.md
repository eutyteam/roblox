# RMR - Roblox Memory Reader
you can use it for fun and research i guess?
rmr is **highly** unstable. 100% that you will crash, i dont know the fix! (if you will do scanning really rarely, like 2 scans per minute, maybe there will not be any crashes)
isnt a malware, it reads memory from robloxplayerbeta.exe process
freely to check it by scanning with virus total!



# RMR Errors

- **Error #1**
- Issue: ![image](https://github.com/eutyteam/robloxpentesting/assets/153383083/50c934c7-6861-452b-baa8-82a5cd93c373)
- Solve: means that you havent opened **web version** of roblox, or roblox updated their security

- **Error #2**
- Issue: text in console keeps resetting / cant find anything
- Solve: u have to reinject (reopen the program)

thats all!
