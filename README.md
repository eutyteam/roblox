- thats only for education purposes, theres nothing dangerous!
- everything is made by @eutylone on discord there
- coding mostly done with python

# RMR - Roblox Memory Reader
- if you want it to not crash instanly, do not search fast and do not type characters like: ~, ", ', \, |, /, etc
- also do not open the program after roblox, you will crash (but you max can do 1 scan, after it breaks, i dont know how this works)
- how to inject: open the program before roblox, after join the game, and press enter in the program

you can use it for fun and research i guess?
rmr is **highly** unstable. 100% that you will crash, i dont know the fix! (if you will do scanning really rarely, like 2 scans per minute, maybe there will not be any crashes)
isnt a malware, it reads memory from robloxplayerbeta.exe process
freely to check it by scanning with virus total!
