# RMR - Roblox Memory Reader
- you can use it for fun and research i guess?
- rmr is **highly** unstable. 80% that you will crash, i dont know the fix! (if you will do scanning really rarely, like 2 scans per minute, maybe there will not be any crashes)
- if it doesnt find anything, reinject it (reopen)
- isnt a malware, it reads memory from robloxplayerbeta.exe process
- freely to check it by scanning with virus total!
- any questions to issues, if not responded - add me on discord @eutylone
